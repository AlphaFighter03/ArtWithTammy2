            <h1>Hi, My name is Tammy.</h1>
            <p>I am based in Richards Bay where i host my Art lessons <a href="https://www.instagram.com/groundedcafe_rb/"> @Ground Cafe</a> </p>
            <br> 
            <p><b>Art With Tammy</b> Was birthed in Septemer 2022, With a group of Ladies who had no artistic skill but wanted to be creative.</p>
            <p>Once a month I host an arcylic Workshop on a saturday morning, choosing a fun theme or topic and break it down into simple steps for everyone to follow along</p> 
            <p>If you attend my workshop, you will leave with a painting that you have created and you will feel accomplished in what you have achieved</p>
            <p>I am a self taught artist,I have been painting since I was 9 years old learning what I need as i go on in this journey.</p>
            <p>I started painting with water colour alongside my mom. Throught the tears experimenting with pencil,pastel and acrylic, but water colour always remaining my favourite...</p>
            <p>until i discovered oil painting</p>
